> Everything is created twice, first in the mind and then in reality ~ Robin Sharma

As the Odoo Community Days approached on August 23 and 24 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, my good friend Sagar and I couldn't contain our excitement about attending this much-anticipated event. With conferences, talks, and exhibitions on offer, it promised to be an enriching experience. What made it even more remarkable was that the event was free to attend and open to everyone! It was like the open-source version of a knowledge-sharing eventâ€”free and accessible to all.

Though we could only make it on the second day, it turned out to be an incredible experience that I can't wait to share.

### The Talk Experience

When attending a talk on a favorite subject, many of us eagerly anticipate the "Any Questions?" segment. It's that moment when we finally get to engage directly, but there's always a limit to how many questions can be asked. Odoo came up with a brilliant way to address this challenge.

Before each talk began, the speaker would share a QR code with the audience. This code linked to a virtual platform where attendees could submit their questions in real-time. The team then responded to these questions as they came in, ensuring that everyone had a chance to engage without disrupting the *flow of the talk.* It was an innovative and seamless way to keep the conversation going and enhance the overall experience.

Here's how it looked, everything in real-time. This was a new experience

### Developer Opportunities

As a developer at the event, I discovered a wealth of opportunities:

* **Connecting with Fellow Developers:** It was a fantastic chance to network with other developers, exchange ideas, and discuss the latest trends in the industry.
    
* **Engaging with Aspiring Students:** I had the pleasure of meeting students eager to learn and break into the field, offering a fresh perspective and enthusiasm.
    
* **Showcasing My Skills:** The event provided an excellent platform to market myself, highlight my expertise, and explore potential collaborations.
    
* **Deepening My Odoo Knowledge:** I also gained valuable insights into Odoo, expanding my understanding and skills with the platform.
    

### YouTubers

Although we missed the first day, Day 2 more than made up for it. We had the chance to meet some well-known Instagram and YouTube personalities, including:

* Gaurav from [OpenLetterYT](https://www.instagram.com/openletteryt/?hl=en)
    
* Abhi and Niyu from [@abhiandniyu](https://www.instagram.com/abhiandniyu/?hl=en)
    
* Raj from [@rajphotoeditingmuchmore](https://www.instagram.com/rajphotoeditingmuchmore/?hl=en)
    

Unfortunately, we missed the talks by Abhi and Niyu, as well as Raj. However, we arrived just in time to catch Gaurav's talk, which turned out to be one of the highlights of our day.

We exchanged words and ideas with Gaurav, and had the opportunity talk about the nation, one-to-one. His talk on YouTube as SME was simply amazing.
